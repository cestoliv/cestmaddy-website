# Configuration

Before you start creating your (super) website, you need to understand how **cestmaddy** works.

**cestmaddy** first uses a configuration file, `config.yml` to set up your website (port, domain, blogs, podcasts, language...)

Then, all the content will be placed in the `source` folder. You will be able to place **Markdown** files, with **Shortcodes**, as well as classic files such as images.

For example, to create `domain.com/hello`

You will need to create a `hello.md` file in the `source` directory.
